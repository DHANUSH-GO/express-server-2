A simple Express server was built using Node.js. It has routes for / and /contact-us that respond to GET requests with messages, and a POST route /tweets that returns “tweet created” with status 201. The server runs on port 8000 using app.listen(), which waits for incoming requests. Routes are tested using Thunder Client, which lets GET and POST requests be sent and responses viewed in real time. This setup demonstrates handling HTTP methods, sending responses, and testing endpoints, forming a solid foundation for building and expanding backend APIs.
